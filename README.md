# FishIT
## About the game

#### A fishing game, created mainly using HTML, JS, and Three.js.
#### The game simulates a fishing environment, by making the user feel like he's actually driving the boat, with a rod attached to it. The user can throw the rod and wait for the collision with a fish, then a counter will be displayed on the screen, keeping the user informed about the amount of time he still has to pull the rod. Otherwise, the fish escapes.

## Opening the game
#### - Go to the project's directory in the terminal/command-prompt shell
#### - Initialize a python server
#### - Open a localhost:8000 from any browser

## Navigating and using the game features
#### - Use W, S, A, D to drive the boat
#### - Use F to throw the rod
#### - Use G to pull the rod

### Enjoy it!
